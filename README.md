## Description
This is a portfolio of my work, built using React to render five different components onto one shared page.

## Technologies
* React
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Nodemailer

## Usage
Using the navigation links, the viewer is able to toggle between each section to learn more about me and my work.

The default section, 'About Me,' contains a photo and a short summary of who I am as a developer.

In the 'Projects' section, view a list of a few of the projects that I have created. Hover over the picture and a description will appear, along with the technologies used to build the application, a link to the deployed application, and a link to the GitHub repository.

The 'Blog' section is an extra add-on that lists a few of my posts on my blog, "Hiking, Coding, and Mayhem." You will see a picture for each post, the title, a short excerpt from the entry, and a link that will take you to the full post on Wordpress.

In the 'Resume' section, I have provided a link to download my full resume using the PDF icon at the top, as well as a list of my proficiencies sorted by front and back end.

In the 'Contact' section, there is a fully functional contact form that can be filled out with your name, email, and a message that will be sent to me. I have also provided my email address and phone number at the bottom in case you want to get in touch directly via one of these methods.

In addition to these five sections, you can use the icons on the bottom from every page that link to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Wordpress.
