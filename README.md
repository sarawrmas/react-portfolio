## Description
This is a portfolio of my work, built using React to render five different components onto one shared page. Using the navigation links, the viewer is able to toggle between each section to learn more.

The default section, 'About Me,' contains a photo and a short summary of who I am as a developer.

You can also view a list of a few of the projects that I have created. For each one, the title and a picture are displayed, followed by two different links to view the deployed application as well as the project's GitHub repository.

The blog section is a little something extra to display a few of the posts I have created. I believe these posts help give a little bit more context about who I am.

In the resume section, I have provided a link to download my full resume, as well as a list of my proficiencies sorted by front and back end.

In the contact section, I have provided a form that can be filled out with a name, email, and a message that will be sent to me. Reach out if you have any questions!

In addition to these four sections, the header and footer are available on every page, containing links to navigate between pages at the top, and links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Wordpress on the bottom.
